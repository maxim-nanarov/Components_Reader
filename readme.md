needs to show:
* CPU 
* RAM
* motherboard temperture and such (also the vlotage given to the mother board and the rest of the componetns)
* the fans and their: vlotage intake + their rounds per minute/second 
* there are some cables that my guy wants so I'll have to check it with him later

I need to learn how the components of the pc and what's exactly are the more important 
parameters that the user would like to see.
